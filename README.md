Analysing author name mentions in citation contexts of highly cited publications
In this paper, we are analysing author name mentions in citation contexts of highly cited articles in a PLOS ONE corpus. First, we have identified author mentions in our corpus of citation contexts. Then, we examined frequent nouns and verbs in the neighbourhood of the identified author mentions using n-grams and utilized these top nouns and verbs to identify the most frequent patterns. We observed that most frequent patterns are associated with the methods which are proposed in the corresponding highly cited references.

Our main objective in this study is to explore some characteristics which could help to identify specific paper types in a set of highly cited publications. Our first approach is to explore surface patterns in the corresponding contexts with author mentions. In this and future work, we plan to use the results of this exploration to introduce methods to better understand the genesis and reasons of an influential work.
